The following design shows the standard module which may be integrated to any ordinary SG3525 inverter across the output pins of the IC for accomplishing a highly efficient SG3525 full bridge or H-bridge inverter circuit. Referring to the above diagram, I have identified the four mosfets rigged as an H-bridge or a full bridge network
