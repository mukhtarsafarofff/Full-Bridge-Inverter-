The following design shows the standard module which may be integrated to any ordinary SG3525 inverter across the output pins of the IC for accomplishing a highly efficient SG3525 full bridge or H-bridge inverter circuit. Referring to the above diagram, I have identified the four mosfets rigged as an H-bridge or a full bridge network. I know that in any H-bridge the mosfets are configured to conduct diagonally for implementing the intended push pull conduction across the transformer or the connected load. This implies that pin#11 of the IC is high during this instance, which keeps the left side BC547 switch ON
