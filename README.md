The following design shows the standard module which may be integrated to any ordinary SG3525 inverter across the output pins of the IC for accomplishing a highly efficient SG3525 full bridge or H-bridge inverter circuit. Referring to the above diagram, I have identified the four mosfets rigged as an H-bridge or a full bridge network. I know that in any H-bridge the mosfets are configured to conduct diagonally for implementing the intended push pull conduction across the transformer or the connected load. This implies that pin#11 of the IC is high during this instance, which keeps the left side BC547 switch ON. In this situation the following things happen withing the left side BC547 stage:
1) The 100uF capacitor charges up via the 1N4007 diode and the low side mosfet connected with its negative terminal.
2) This charge is temporarily stored inside the capacitor and may be assumed to be equal to the supply voltage.
3) Now as soon as the logic across the SG3525 reverts with the subsequent oscillating cycle, the pin#11 goes low, which instantly switches OFF the associated BC547.
4) With BC547 switched OFF, the supply voltage at the cathode of the 1N007 now reaches the gate of the connected mosfet, however this voltage is now reinforced with the stored voltage inside capacitor which is also almost equal to the supply level.
5) This results in a doubling effect and enables a raised 2X voltage at the gate of the relevant mosfet.
